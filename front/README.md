Inspector Gadget React API (front-end)
======================================
The front-end was made with Create-React-App.
Linux or MacOS are recommended.

## Requirement
- node-js
- npm or yarn

### node-js
To install 'node-js', using 'nvm' is recommended:
it can easily update 'node-js' version.

You can do it by running:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

By this,  you can also use npm.

### yarn
I recommend you to use 'yarn' instead of 'npm' : it is much faster.
Follow [this link](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) to install it.


## Installation

Using `npm` or `yarn` in the `gadgetProj/front` directory,
you can install front-end.

npm : `npm install`
yarn : `yarn`

## Execution

In the `gadgetProj/front` directory, you can run using npm:

### `npm start`

Or using yarn:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
